## This is Next js Project which is based on form validation using react as front end and Next js as backend 

## Start
As I have used react as front end and Next js as backend ,  I installed  it using command 

### npx create-next-app app_name
and this has installed react, next js and other required dependices for creating Next Js Application. After that the necessaty file and folders are cerated which were required.

## Creating Front end 
I have created react-component and creating various states for saving the form data, error information and other required resources and Form component. Error validation on front end side is also handled and in most cases different operations are seperated to individual module.

## Backend
React api is used for serving as a backend for this project in which request is provided by hitting th url using fetch api. Here the form data is reached via post request. 

Various checks are made like if a file already exist or not and on the basis of that file is created and record is added. If file already exist than and  email and phone value does not exist is previous record than data is appended to the file without the headers
