## This is Next js Project which is based on form validation using react as front end and Next js as backend 

## Start
As I have used react as front end and Next js as backend ,  I installed  it using command 

### npx create-next-app app_name
and this has installed react, next js and other required dependices for creating Next Js Application. After that the necessaty file and folders are cerated which were required.

## Creating Front end 
I have created react-component and creating various states for saving the form data, error information and other required resources and Form component. Error validation on front end side is also handled and in most cases different operations are seperated to individual module.

## Backend
React api is used for serving as a backend for this project in which request is provided by hitting th url using fetch api. Here the form data is reached via post request. 

Various checks are made like if a file already exist or not and on the basis of that file is created and record is added. If file already exist than and  email and phone value does not exist is previous record than data is appended to the file without the headers

## Remarks
This project is not completed as you have instruced me to build and also there are some bugs. But due to the deadline date I have submitted this upto where I have completed. Please pardon me for this and review my code. I will try update this as soon as possible and make commit on this project.

I found some diffuculity in creating this app because I am new to Next js and and stuck in most of the cases while creating this. Thus i had to spend decent amount of time learning next js its featues. But I had invested my decent effort to figure out ways for making this app as per requirement. So, please consider my effort and spare sometime reviewing this app and agian pardon me for since I could not met your deadline.
